#Landing Page
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality being used serves two purposes: to append dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

Open and view the Project using the .zip file provided or at my Github Repository.

The project is also hosted on Github.

#Instructions
The starter code has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open js/app.js and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
